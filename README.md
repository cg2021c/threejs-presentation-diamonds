Hello guys, so far we have learned many things in Three.Js including :
1. Working with Light sources
2. Working with Various Materials
3. Geometries
4. Advanced Geometries
5. Point and Sprites

We learned how to render things, give lighting to it, experimented with many cool and exciting materials, shapes, and even play with points and sprites. Now, imagine if we can make our objects move in a certain way, change in a certain way, **animate**.

In this opportunity, we will learn about **Animations**. But not only that, we will learn about how to **play with camera**, how to view our Three.js world through various camera-works. This time, we will delve deeper into :
1. Basic Animations
   - The basic animations
   - Objects selection
   - Animation with Tween.js
2. Working with The Camera
   - Trackball controls
   - Fly controls
   - First person controls
   - Orbit controls
3. Morphing and Skeletal Animation
   - Morph targets
   - Morph targets manually
   - Bones manually
4. Creating Animations Using External Models
   - Animation from blender
   - Animation from COLLADA
   - Animation from MD2
   - Animation from glTF
   - Visualize motions captured models using the fbxLoader
   - Loading legacy DirectX models through the xLoader
   - Visualizing a skeleton with the BVHLoader
   - Reusing models from the SEA3D project


With that said, let's **_Roll_**
